        <h2>Video creator</h2>
        <p>I have a long history of video creation.
            <br>
            <br>
            A long experience from camera operation and Director Of Photography to directing and all the way to producing, 
            my knowledge spans trough many years and many different types of projects. Starting at the age of 15 with a simple handycamera I began creating skateboarding and 
            snowboarding montages for the fun of it. By the age of 18 I had created my own first snowboarding documentaries.
            I gained a great skill with handheld filming, followcams and fish-eye filming in general. Filming in extreme conditions became a very common practice during the finnish winters.
            <br>
            <br>
            As the years went on I gradually shifted to creating musicvideos, still editing all of my projects myself. Later on at 2015 I created my
            own company Niko Savioja Tuotanto and went on to create and produce commercials for small time businesses.
